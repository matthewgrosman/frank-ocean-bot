# Frank Ocean Bot

## What is this project?
The **Frank Ocean Bot** is a Discord bot that will thoroughly inform your server about any and all 
things Frank Ocean. Fun facts, trivia, music suggestions... your server will be  FRANKTASTIC.
**Frank Ocean Bot** can share Frank Ocean trivia, suggest songs, send lyrics, and even given give
you a countdown until Frank performs at Coachella! The bot also comes packaged with a copypasta
that is triggered whenever anyone sends the words "frank", "ocean" or "blonde" into a channel :)

## How did you make this project?
I took advantage of the [Discord APIs](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro) to create a bot.

I used a few tutorials to help learn the basics of building a Discord bot, I'll link those
as well incase anyone wants a nice guide:
* https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-a-discord-bot-with-python/
* https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/building-a-discord-bot-in-python/

## What's next?
I don't really have any plans to host this and make it available for people to add it to their 
server, but feel free to fork this and use it or deploy it however you want.
